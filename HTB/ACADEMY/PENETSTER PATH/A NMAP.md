## Syntax


```shell
nmap <scan types> <options> <target>
```




# Host Discovery


- actively ==discover== online systems in a network during pentest
- to determine whether our target is alive or not => **ICMP echo requests** (effective)


#### Scan Network Range

- host alive in a network

```shell
pradyun2005@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.0/24 -sn -oA tnet | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```

- Now what is meant by "/24" [Click here](obsidian://open?vault=Spidey_Notes&file=NETWORKS%2FSUBNET)

|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`10.129.2.0/24`|Target network range.|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA tnet`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.|


- we Have bunch of ips we need to do port scan for all these hosts......How?

- save all these ip in a file 

```shell
pradyun2005@htb[/htb]$ cat hosts.lst

10.129.2.4
10.129.2.10
10.129.2.11
10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
10.129.2.28
```


```shell
pradyun2005@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sn -oA tnet -iL hosts.lst | grep for | cut -d" " -f5

10.129.2.18
10.129.2.19
10.129.2.20
```


|**Scanning Options**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`-sn`|Disables port scanning.|
|`-oA tnet`|Stores the results in all formats starting with the name 'tnet'.|
|`-iL`|Performs defined scans against targets in provided 'hosts.lst' list.|


- may be because of firewall some packets are dropped


#### Scan Multiple Ip

- scans from `10.129.2.18` to `10.129.2.20`
```shell
nmap -sn -oA tnet 10.129.2.18-20| grep for | cut -d" " -f5
```



## Scan Single IP

- scan a single host for open ports and its services , first check host is alive or not


```shell-session
pradyun2005@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-14 23:59 CEST

- Now `Ping` and `nmap -sn` do same???..
	- no,Ping only send and receive ICMP packets
	- `nmap -sn` sends ICMP packets,TCP-SYN flag,ARP ping etc..

- example ARP ping request
```shell
pradyun2005@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.2.18 -sn -oA host -PE --packet-trace

## Scan Techniques

### TCP-SYN scan (`-sS`)

- **SYN Flag**:
    - Contains randomly generated ISN.
    - Initiates TCP connection.

    - Sends one SYN packet.
    - Does not complete the three-way handshake.
    - **Responses**:
        - `SYN-ACK` => Port is **Open**.
        - `RST` => Port is **Closed**.
        - No response => Port is **Filtered** (possibly due to a firewall).
```shell
nmap -sS <target>
```


### TCP Connect Scan (`-sT`) 

1. **Three-Way Handshake**:
    
    - Uses TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
2. **Port States**:
    
    - **Open**: SYN-ACK response.
    - **Closed**: RST response.
3. **Accuracy**:
    
    - Most accurate for determining port state.
4. **Stealth**:
    
    - No unfinished connections or unsent packets.
    - Less likely to be detected by IDS/IPS.
5. **Polite**:
    
    - Minimal impact on target services.
    - Suitable for mapping networks without disruption.
6. **Firewall Bypass**:
    
    - Can bypass personal firewalls that drop incoming but allow outgoing packets.
7. **Speed**:
    
    - Slower due to waiting for responses.
    - May be affected by target's responsiveness.

## Nmap Aggressive Scan (-A)

#### Components 

1. **Service Version Detection (-sV):**
    
    - **Description:** Identifies the versions of services running on open ports.
    - **Usage:** Helps in finding vulnerabilities specific to certain versions.
    - **Example:** `nmap -sV <target>`
2. **OS Detection (-O):**
    
    - **Description:** Attempts to determine the operating system of the target machine.
    - **Usage:** Useful for understanding the target environment.
    - **Example:** `nmap -O <target>`
3. **Traceroute (--traceroute):**
    
    - **Description:** Maps the network path to the target.
    - **Usage:** Helps in identifying intermediate network devices and paths.
    - **Example:** `nmap --traceroute <target>`
4. **Default NSE Scripts (-sC):**
    
    - **Description:** Runs a set of default Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) scripts.
    - **Usage:** Automates the detection of common vulnerabilities and gathers additional information.
    - **Example:** `nmap -sC <target>`




# Nmap Scripting Engine

- `nmap <target> --script <category>`

##### Category

|**Category**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`auth`|Determination of authentication credentials.|
|`broadcast`|Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.|
|`brute`|Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.|
|`default`|Default scripts executed by using theÂ `-sC`Â option.|
|`discovery`|Evaluation of accessible services.|
|`dos`|These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.|
|`exploit`|This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.|
|`external`|Scripts that use external services for further processing.|
|`fuzzer`|This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.|
|`intrusive`|Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.|
|`malware`|Checks if some malware infects the target system.|
|`safe`|Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.|
|`version`|Extension for service detection.|
|`vuln`|Identification of specific vulnerabilities.|



# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

### ==Decoy Scanning Method (`-D`)==

**Purpose:**  
Disguises the origin of the scan by inserting multiple fake IP addresses (decoys) into the IP header, making it difficult for the target to identify the true source of the scan.

#### Key Points:

- **Avoids Detection:**
    
    - Helps evade IDS/IPS and firewalls that block specific subnets or regions.
- **Generates Decoys:**
    
    - Creates multiple fake IP addresses to obscure the real source.

#### How It Works:

- **Random IP Addresses:**
    
    - Generates a specific number of random IP addresses.
    - The real IP address is mixed randomly among these decoys. 
- **Syntax:**
    
    - Use `-D RND:<number_of_decoys>` to generate random decoys.
    - Use `-D <decoy1>,<decoy2>,<decoy3>,<your_IP>` to specify exact decoys.
- **Example with Random Decoys:**
    
    - Generates 5 random decoys, with the real IP in the second position:
        

        
        `nmap -D RND:5 <target>`
        
- **Example with Specified Decoys:**
    
    - Uses specified decoys and places the real IP at a specific position:
        
        
        `nmap -D decoy1,decoy2,192.168.1.100,decoy3 <target>`
        

#### Critical Considerations:

- **Alive Decoys:**
    - Ensure decoy IP addresses are live (responsive) to avoid detection by SYN-flooding protections.
- **Position of Real IP:**
    - The real IP is randomly placed among the decoys, making tracking harder.

### Usage:

- **Purpose:**
    
    - To mask the origin of the scan.
    - Useful for bypassing regional or subnet-based access restrictions and evading security mechanisms.

```

- **Source IP Address (-S option):**
    
    - Specifies the source IP address for packets sent during the scan.
    - Does not assign an IP address to the specified interface.
- **Interface Selection (-e option):**
    
    - Specifies the network interface (`tun0`, `eth0`, etc.) for sending packets.
    - Requires the interface to be already configured with an IP address.
- **Example Command:**
    
    - `sudo nmap 10.129.2.28 -n -Pn -p 445 -O -S 10.129.2.200 -e tun0`
        - Uses `10.129.2.200` as the source IP address (`-S` option).
        - Specifies `tun0` as the network interface (`-e` option).
- **IP Address Assignment:**
    
    - `-S` option sets the source IP address for the scan.
    - `-e` option specifies the network interface for sending packets.
- **Effect on Scanning:**
    
    - Ensures packets are sent from the specified source IP (`-S`) through the specified interface (`-e`).
    - Does not configure or assign IP addresses to interfaces through Nmap itself.





### ==DNS Proxying with Nmap==

1. **Reverse DNS Resolution:**
    
    - Nmap defaults to performing reverse DNS resolution (`-n` to disable).
    - Helps identify hostnames associated with target IP addresses.
2. **DNS Queries and Ports:**
    
    - UDP Port 53: Used for standard DNS queries.
    - TCP Port 53: Traditionally for zone transfers, now more common due to IPv6 and DNSSEC.
3. **Specifying DNS Servers:**
    
    - `--dns-server <ns>,<ns>`: Specifies DNS servers for resolution.
    - Useful in DMZs for using trusted internal DNS servers (`--dns-server`).
4. **Use Cases:**
    
    - Secure Scans: Route queries through trusted DNS infrastructure.
    - Compliance: Ensure DNS requests align with internal security policies.
5. **Source Port Manipulation:**
    
    - `--source-port 53`: Sets TCP port 53 as the source port.
    - May bypass firewall rules that trust DNS traffic.
6. **Advantages:**
    
    - Trustworthiness: Internal DNS servers are more trusted than public ones.
    - Security: Helps in maintaining security posture during scans.

# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion â Easy Lab

- OS (Operating System) identification can be done using SMB (Server Message Block) services
- use `--script smb-os-discovery`

```shell
nmap --script smb-os-discovery 10.129.2.80
```

# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion â Medium Lab

- to find out  targetâs DNS server version
- port 53 is used for DNS services (`-sSU`) performs both TCP and UDP
- `--script dns-nsid` used for gather information from the DNS server.

```
sudo nmap -sSU -p53 10.129.249.220 --script dns-nsid

```

# Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion - Hard Lab

- nmap shows 50000 port is open by specified 53 as source port
- we can grab the banner using nc to get more information from 53 (source port)
