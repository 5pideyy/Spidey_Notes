# Script

I followed the same methodology that I typically use for HackTheBox machines, starting from recon


- **Port Scanning with Nmap:**  
    I started by scanning the target system using Nmap to identify open ports. This revealed four main open ports, including services like GraphQL and Apache, which are key entry points.
    
- **Directory Fuzzing with Dirsearch:**  
    Next, I used Dirsearch to brute-force directories . This allowed me to uncover interesting files and directories such as `/config.txt`, `/swagger.json`, `/phpmyadmin`, and others, which could contain sensitive information or misconfigurations.
    
- **Sitemap Building with Burp Suite:**  
    To maintain a comprehensive view of the web application, I manually explored the site using Burp Suite. This helped me populate a complete sitemap, making it easier to track discovered endpoints and resources.
    



Once reconnaissance was complete, I moved on to identifying vulnerabilities and extracting flags. Hereâ€™s how I approached each discovery:

- **SSL Certificate Flag:**  
    I noticed that the SSL certificate contained an encrypted flag and hinted as Zigzag encryption method. I decrypted it to reveal the flag
    
- **Shellshock Vulnerability:**  
    When I visited the Apache web service, I found the word `shocking`, which hinted at a possible Shellshock vulnerability. By examining the source code, I discovered a CGI endpoint. Using HackTricks documentation, I was able to retrieve the flag from the `/follow` directory.
    
- **Database Flag:**  
    The `/config.txt` file contained a reference to `./IMPORTANTDATABASEHERE`. Accessing this directory led me to another flag.
    
- **Directory Listing:**  
    Directory listing was enabled in the `/resource/img` directory. Within this, I discovered a `secret` directory that contained a `flag.html` file. The flag was easily extracted from the source code.
    
- **PhpMyAdmin Access:**  
    I attempted to log into PhpMyAdmin using default credentials and succeeded. Inside, I found a flag in the `users` table, which required exporting to view fully.
    
- **API Flag:**  
    The `/swagger.json` file provided valuable information about the available API endpoints. By calling the `fetch_all_user` API, I obtained another flag.
    
- **Insecure Deserialization:**  
    The `shutdown.php` endpoint set two cookies, one containing a file path. By modifying the other cookie, which is a serialized object, to point to `/etc/flag/1.txt` and adjusting the string length, I was able to capture the flag.
    
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  
    in the `/API/users/complaintupdate.php` endpoint, I discovered a SQL injection vulnerability. By exploiting it, I dumped the entire database, which revealed two flags (SQLi and SSTI flag), as well as encrypted passwords for several users, including admins and technician
    
- **JWT Flag:**  
    While monitoring the login process with Burp Suite, I intercepted and modified the request, specifically the encrypted password. This manipulation allowed me to obtain a JWT token for a technician, which I then used to access `/api/list_reading.php` and retrieve a flag.
    
- **Error Flag:**  
    Accessing a non-existent directory returned an error message containing a flag.
    
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  
    The `/developer.json` file pointed me to the `/developer.php` endpoint, which was similar to `/index.php`. By comparing the source code using Burp Suiteâ€™s comparator, I found a `sensitive.txt` file with another flag.
