#  Cracking Native Libraries on Android

Ever wondered how some Android apps seem to hide all their secrets in **native code**, far from the friendly land of Java or Kotlin? Welcome to the mysterious world of `.so` files, JNI, and a bit of reverse engineering wizardry.

##  The Native Side of Android

Most Android apps are written in Java/Kotlin. But when they want more **speed**, **security**, or just to be extra sneaky 👀, they use **native code** — written in **C or C++** and compiled into `.so` shared libraries.

These `.so` files:

- Are compiled for your phone’s CPU (ARM, x86, etc.)
    
- Run natively — not in the JVM
    
- Usually hide sensitive logic like license checks, encryption, or flag validation in C/C++

##  Meet JNI: Java’s Plug to the Native Matrix

> Java Native Interface (JNI) = a bridge between Java/Kotlin and C/C++

It lets Java code call native code and vice versa. Think of it as:

```
Android Java/Kotlin ↔ C/C++ (.so file)
```

You write something like this in Java:

```
public native int add(int a, int b); // We declare it, but code lives in C/C++

static {
    System.loadLibrary("native-lib"); // This loads native-lib.so
}
```

And the native part (in C++) looks like:

```
JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL
Java_com_example_MyClass_add(JNIEnv* env, jobject obj, jint a, jint b) {
    return a + b; // Finally, C does some work!
}
```

Yes, that method name is ridiculously long. But it's how **JNI dynamically links** your Java method to the correct C function.

##  So, What the Heck Is `JNIEnv*`?

Glad you asked.

`JNIEnv*` is like your **remote control** to Java — from inside native code. It lets C/C++ do things like:

- Create Java objects
    
- Call Java methods
    
- Throw exceptions
    
- Manipulate strings, arrays, etc.
    

### The Call Flow

```
MainActivity.java
    ↓
Calls native method `add()`
    ↓
JNI jumps into .so file
    ↓
Runs C++ function `Java_com_example_MyClass_add(...)`
    ↓
You can now "talk back" to Java via JNIEnv*
```

In short: you're in C, but still whispering sweet Java nothings. 💬

##  Two Ways to Link Java <--> C/C++

There are two flavors of JNI linking:

### 1. **Dynamic Linking**

You follow the naming pattern:

```
Java_<package>_<Class>_<method>
```

Java:

```
public native void sayHello();
```

C/C++:

```
JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_com_example_myapp_MyClass_sayHello(JNIEnv* env, jobject obj) {
    printf("Hi!\n");
}
```

### 2. **Static Linking** (a.k.a. I’m too cool for long names)

Here, you **register** native functions manually using `RegisterNatives`.

Java:

```
public native String doWork(int num);
```

C++:

```
jstring myFunction(JNIEnv* env, jobject obj, jint num) {
    return env->NewStringUTF("Work done!");
}
```

Then, you tell Java:  
“Hey! When you call `doWork()`, run `myFunction()` instead.”

```
static JNINativeMethod methods[] = {
    {"doWork", "(I)Ljava/lang/String;", (void*)myFunction}
};
```
Let’s break down that strange-looking method signature:

|Part|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`I`|Parameter is an `int`|
|`Ljava/lang/String;`|Return type is `String`|
|`()`|Wraps the arguments|

Finally, we register it when the library is loaded:

```
JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL JNI_OnLoad(JavaVM* vm, void* reserved) {
    JNIEnv* env;
    vm->GetEnv((void**)&env, JNI_VERSION_1_6);

    jclass clazz = env->FindClass("com/example/MyClass");
    env->RegisterNatives(clazz, methods, 1);

    return JNI_VERSION_1_6;
}
```

Boom. Static linkage.

> Bonus: This can make reverse engineering harder because names don’t follow that Java-style pattern. 😏

##  Reversing .so Files Like a Pro

When you're reversing an APK with `.so` files:

1. **Use JADX** to check out the Java code
    
2. Find `native` method declarations
    
3. Open the `.so` in **Ghidra** (or IDA, or Hopper)
    
4. If it’s static linkage, look for `RegisterNatives`
    
5. If it’s dynamic, look for those long, ugly `Java_com_example_X_Y` names
    
6. Match the signatures and figure out the logic
    

### Bonus: Ghidra + JNI

To make life easier, load JNI definitions:

1. Grab a `.gdt` file like `jni_all.gdt`
    
2. Import it in Ghidra
    
3. Go to your function
    
4. Right-click the first parameter (usually `undefined *param_1`)
    
5. Change it to `JNIEnv *`
    

Now your disassembly starts to make sense and looks a bit less like alien script.

##  TL;DR

- Native code (`.so` files) runs directly on the CPU, often hiding secrets.
    
- JNI is the bridge between Java and native.
    
- Use `JNIEnv*` to manipulate Java stuff from C.
    
- Linking can be **dynamic** (name-based) or **static** (`RegisterNatives`).
    
- Reverse engineering involves jadx + Ghidra (with JNI definitions).

 **Fun Fact**: If you ever find yourself naming a function like  
`Java_com_super_secure_bankapp_MoneyManager_validateUser`,  
just know some reverse engineer is gonna find it in 5 seconds. Use `RegisterNatives` if you’re feeling spicy. 🌶️
