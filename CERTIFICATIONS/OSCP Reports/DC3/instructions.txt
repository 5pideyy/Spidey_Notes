I had WS02 carbon open on port 9763, https://github.com/LaiKash/JSP-Reverse-and-Web-Shell/blob/main/shell.jsp download this and add the ip and port and run with pyhthon
That gives a netcat listener
Then run winpeas and unquoted service path in trigone directory
Next i found Alice.walters and did mimikatz sekurlsa::logonpasswords and then i found a hash, crackstation.com found password and i could login on next pc
