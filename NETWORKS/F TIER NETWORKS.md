THREE TIER:

CORE LAYER
DISTRIBUTION LAYER
ACCESS LAYER

ACCESS LAYER , Network Administration Control is cisco feature that prevents hosts from accessing the netowrk if they do not copmply with organiizational requirements.Because acess layer devixces provide access to the network

Distribution layer , which is sometimes reffered to as the aggregation layer, provides route filtering and interVLAN routing...It  is the intermediary between access layer and core layer.

CORE LAYER , it provides fastest switching path in the network.as the network backbone , he core layer is primiraily associated with low latency and high reliability.

Tier 1 contains basic access points like switch pi, devices etc...

Tier 2 contains its big switches

Tier 3 contains bigger switches than Tier 2




TWO TIER:

Collapsed core layer
Access layer
