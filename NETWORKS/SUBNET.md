10.129.2.0/24 what is this mean explain me clearly "/24"

The notation "10.129.2.0/24" is a way of representing an IP address along with its subnet mask using CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of what each part means:

### IP Address

**10.129.2.0**:

- This is an IPv4 address.
- It is used as the network address in this context. The network address identifies the specific network to which a group of IP addresses belongs.

### CIDR Notation

**/24**:

- This indicates the subnet mask associated with the IP address.
- The number 24 specifies the number of bits set to 1 in the subnet mask.

### Subnet Mask

To understand what "/24" means, let's look at the binary representation of an IPv4 address and subnet mask.

- IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, divided into four 8-bit octets.
- A subnet mask with "/24" means the first 24 bits of the subnet mask are set to 1, and the remaining 8 bits are set to 0.

In binary form, this looks like:

Copy code

`11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`

In decimal form, this converts to:

Copy code

`255.255.255.0`

### Network and Host Portion

With a /24 subnet mask:

- The first 24 bits (the network portion) are used to identify the network.
- The remaining 8 bits (the host portion) are used to identify individual hosts within that network.

### Address Range

Given the network address 10.129.2.0/24, we can determine the range of IP addresses within this network:

- **Network address**: 10.129.2.0 (all host bits are 0)
- **Broadcast address**: 10.129.2.255 (all host bits are 1)
- **Usable IP addresses**: From 10.129.2.1 to 10.129.2.254

There are 256 possible addresses in total (from 10.129.2.0 to 10.129.2.255), but the first address (network address) and the last address (broadcast address) are reserved, leaving 254 usable addresses for hosts.

### Summary

- **10.129.2.0**: The network address.
- **/24**: The subnet mask, indicating that the first 24 bits are used for the network part of the address.
- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
- **Usable Host Range**: 10.129.2.1 to 10.129.2.254

This notation is widely used in networking to define IP address ranges and to manage IP address allocation efficiently.
