### Main Differences Between SMB and FTP

1. **Purpose and Functionality**:
    
    - **SMB**:
        - Used for sharing resources like files and directories within a local area network (LAN).
        - Changes made to shared files and directories reflect immediately for all users with access.
        - It allows networked files and resources to be accessed as if they were on the local machine.
    - **FTP**:
        - Used for transferring files between a client and a server.
        - It involves explicitly uploading and downloading files.
        - It doesn't provide real-time shared access; instead, it moves files from one location to another.
2. **Environment**:
    
    - **SMB**:
        - Typically used in LANs and closely associated with Windows environments but also supported on other operating systems like Linux with Samba.
    - **FTP**:
        - Can be used over both LANs and WANs, and is platform-independent, making it versatile for internet file transfers.
3. **Usage Scenario**:
    
    - **SMB**:
        - Ideal for collaborative environments where multiple users need to access and edit shared files and resources simultaneously.
    - **FTP**:
        - Suitable for scenarios where files need to be uploaded or downloaded from a remote server, such as publishing a website or transferring large datasets.

### Practical Examples

- **SMB Example**:
    
    - You map a network drive on your computer to access shared documents on a colleagueâ€™s machine. Any changes you make to the documents are immediately available to your colleague as well.
- **FTP Example**:
    
    - You connect to a remote FTP server to upload the latest version of a website. After uploading, you disconnect from the server, and the files are now available on the web server for public access.
