-   WAN stands for Wide Area Network, which is a computer network that covers a large geographic area.
-   MPLS stands for Multiprotocol Label Switching, which is a technology that improves the efficiency and reliability of data transmission over a WAN.
-   Traditional routing in a WAN involves each router making an individual decision about where to send data packets next, based on the destination address.
-   MPLS uses labels to identify data packets and create a predetermined path for them to follow through the network.
-   The path that data packets take in MPLS is called an MPLS tunnel or LSP (Label Switched Path).
-   Labels are added to data packets by the first router in the path, and subsequent routers simply forward the packets based on the labels.
-   MPLS can prioritize certain types of traffic, such as voice or video, over other types of traffic, to ensure that they get the bandwidth and quality of service they need.
-   WAN MPLS helps computer networks work better over large distances by creating predetermined paths for data packets to follow, leading to faster and more reliable transmission times.
