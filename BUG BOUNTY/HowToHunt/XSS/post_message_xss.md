# Post message xss
specifically in the event listener of postMessage requests that do not check the origin before accessing data. As a result, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious data to your application from a null (sandboxed iframe) and pretending that it came from a trusted source. This could lead to a number of security risks such as data theft or other malicious activities.
